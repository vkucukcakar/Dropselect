# dropselect

jQuery plugin to make Bootstrap dropdown to "behave like" html select element

* Requires jQuery, Bootstrap


Note:
dropselect was first introduced for Bootstrap v3. But Bootstrap v4's select menu is now rendered pretty well 
on most modern browsers but not styled same on all browsers. That's why I have added Bootstrap v4 
support to dropselect jQuery plugin. (For comparison, see: examples/example-bootstrap4.html)
